"1012","You will never (ever!) see a ""questionable"" distance in dead center.

Those who ""question"" down the line (implicitly) think of the fence as some sort of arc of a circle, every point equidistant from home. Even though the numbers on the wall clearly show that it is not circular."
"1013","Your annual reminder distance down the line (around 330 ft) is 70 feet more shallow than in dead center (around 400 ft)

This means a ball clearing fence by 65 feet down line would not be a HR in dead center

A double, after all, is not just a double."
"1130","Obviously, this is alot of numbers.  The next step is to apply RE24 (run expectancy by the 24 out matrix) to see how many runs his doubles are worth, compared to the league average.

And of course doing it for all outs and all runner scenarios."
"1131","This is Castellanos, since 2016, 28 doubles with runner on 1B and 1 outs.  In yellow on the right is the ""league average"", pro-rated to 28 doubles.

To read first line: one time, his double scored the runner and got himself out.  The league average is 0.3

"2928","@EJLantigua Do you mean generally speaking, or do you mean for each specific error?"
"2929","@ckurcon Sounds good.  So to answer more generally: since I am looking at top 10, then removing a teammate won't have much of an effect, since the next person will take the place of the person removed, and there won't be much of a dropoff (not at the scale we are talking about)."
"2930","@pffundraising My hockey fandom started right after Orr's Bruins career was over.  I wouldn't be ridiculous enough to suggest Bourque or Coffey or Lidstrom or anyone else is anywhere close to Orr."

These Ovechkin and McDavid takes are the most ridiculous things in the world.  They are among the best players ever.  But to say they are THE BEST is another level of silly."
"2932","@ckurcon In other words, it doesn't really matter how you handle the Draisaitl issue.  It still works out.

The bigger Drai issue is that he finished ahead of McD one year, and he is currently ahead of McD this season.   Gretzky towered over his opponents and his (Cup winning) teammates."
"2933","@ckurcon Last season: McD had 1.875 pts/g, the top 10 with Draisaitl had 1.24. Remove Drai and replace him with the 11th player and you get 1.20.  So, McD is 56% above instead of 51%. But it's certainly unfair to let McD keep all his points if you do that. Remove only 3: 51%."
"2934","@ckurcon They are helping each other, no?  When Draisaitl led the league in scoring (1.55 pts/g to McDavid 1.52), what would you suggest? Taking off 10 points from Draisaitl for getting to play with McDavid... but you'd have to remove ~10 for McDavid for playing with Draisaitl."

"2962","... while other clubs might find value in players above the .250 level, maybe even above .200.

Somewhere around .300 is going to be the landing spot, and it's just a matter of finding how close to there it actually is. Both @fangraphs and @baseball_ref have settled on around..."
"2963","... that is where the work of aspiring saberists will come in.  You get into more nuanced discussions, especially as it comes with minor league players. A club that relies heavily on their minor leagues might only see value in players above the .350 level, maybe even above .400,"
"2964","And that's Where we set the replacement level, right around .300 win%.  It's the point at which we've established in various ways, even intuitively as the crowd just did, as to how to balance players with uneven playing time.  Whether the true number is closer to .250 or .350..."
"2965","I also asked in a second poll to trade a 7-3 player, and the folks went with 6-0 with a leaning toward 5-0.  In other words 6-0 plus 1-3 equals 7-3.  That's a .250 win%.  And 5-0 plus 2-3 equals 7-3.  That's a .400 win%.  Again, the crowd landing right around ~.300 win%."
"2966","That said, folks might think .250 was far too low, and .500 was closer to the right answer.  Some folks even thought .250 was not low enough and went with a .000 implied replacement level.  Overall, the average was ~.300 win%."
"2967","7-3, with leaning toward 8-2. Those who want 7-3 are saying that adding 1 win and 3 losses to 6-0 would make both players even. Thats a .250 win%.

Those who want 8-2 are saying adding 2-2. Thats a .500 win%.  Clearly 8-2 is better than 6-0 since adding average players has value."
